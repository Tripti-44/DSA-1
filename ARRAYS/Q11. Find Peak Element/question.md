# Q11. Find Peak Element

LeetCode: [Find Peak Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/)

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`, find a peak element and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞`. You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

## Sample Test Cases

- Input: `nums = [1,2,3,1]`
  Output: `2`
  Explanation: `nums[2] = 3` is a peak element and the function should return the index `2`.

- Input: `nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]`
  Output: `5`
  Explanation: The function can return either index `1` (peak element `2`) or index `5` (peak element `6`).

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
- `nums[i] != nums[i + 1]` for all valid `i`
